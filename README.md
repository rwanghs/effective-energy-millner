Effective energy.ipynb will contain millner's algorithm. Attenuation data formatted for this specific notebook can be found in the attenuation data folder.

The paper can be found here: https://www.cirsinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/062-MIllner.pdf
The code is functional but very hardcoded--it was initially designed as a proof of concept/used for testing purposes. I would suggest ignoring the attenuation data folder and utilizing Dale's attenuation.jl package for improvements on this program.
